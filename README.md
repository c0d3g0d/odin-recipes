The Odin Project - fundamentals - html project

This is the project exercise from TOP web development fundamentals course. The aim is to build a simple website using very fundamental HTML elements that have been introduced in the course such as: img, links, lists

--- However, I'm more interested in practicing Git as there is nothing new for me to learn about html here.
